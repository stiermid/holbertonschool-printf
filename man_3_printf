.TH _PRINTF 3 "January 2026" "Holberton Project" "Library Functions Manual"
.SH NAME
_printf \- formatted output conversion

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.sp
.BI "int _printf(const char *" format ", ...);"

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B _printf()
function writes output to stdout, according to a format string. It duplicates the functionality of the standard
.BR printf (3)
function for specific conversion specifiers.
.PP
The
.I format
string is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not
.B %
), which are copied unchanged to the output stream, and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.

.SH CONVERSION SPECIFIERS
A character sequence beginning with
.B %
indicates a conversion specifier. The following characters are supported:
.TP
.B %c
The
.I int
argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
.TP
.B %s
The
.I "char *"
argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte. If the pointer is NULL, "(null)" is printed.
.TP
.B %d, %i
The
.I int
argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.TP
.B %%
A double percent sign is used to write a literal '%' character. No argument is converted.

.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, the
.B _printf
function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
.PP
If an output error is encountered, or if
.I format
is NULL, a value of \-1 is returned.

.SH EXAMPLES
.B #include "main.h"
.PP
.nf
_printf("Char: %c\en", 'A');
// Output: Char: A

_printf("String: %s\en", "Hey!");
// Output: String: Hey!

_printf("Number: %i\en", -42);
// Output: Number: -42
.fi
